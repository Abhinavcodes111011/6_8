            <p>He founded the Adani Group in 1988 and diversified his business into resources, logistics, energy, agriculture, defence and aerospace, amongst others.<br>Adani Group is an Indian multinational conglomerate, headquartered in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India. It was founded by Gautam Adani in 1988 as a commodity trading business, with the flagship company Adani Enterprises Limited (previously Adani Exports Limited). The Group's diverse businesses include energy, resources, logistics, agribusiness, real estate, financial services, defence and aerospace.[3] The group has annual revenue of over US$ 13 billion[4] with operations at 70 locations in 50 countries.[5][6] It is India's largest port developer and operator with ten ports and terminals including Mundra Port, its largest.[7] Through a joint venture with Wilmar International in Singapore, the Group co-owns India's largest edible oil brand, Fortune Oil.[8]

                In April 2014, it added the fourth unit of 660 megawatts at its Tiroda Thermal Power Station, making Adani Power India's largest private power producer. In 2015, Adani was ranked India's most trusted infrastructure brand by The Brand Trust Report 2015.[9] The Group operates mines in India, Indonesia and Australia and supplies coal to Bangladesh, China, and countries in Southeast Asia. The Group handled a total cargo of 200 megatonnes (Mt) in 2018–19.[10] It has a coal mine in Bunyu, North Kalimantan, Indonesia, which produced 3.9 Mt of coal in 2016–17.

                The Group has made the largest investment by an Indian company in Australia at the controversial Carmichael coal mine in the Galilee Basin, Queensland, but development of this mine is as of 2020 the subject of a court challenge to the Australian Government over its lack of adherence to environmental legislation.[11]

                In January 2018, the logistics and SEZ arm of the Group, Adani Ports &amp; SEZ, added equipment and machinery to become the largest dredger fleet in India.[12] The Group was the first in India to build a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system, commissioned in May 2012.[13][14]

                In April 2021, Adani Group became the 3rd Indian conglomerate to cross USD100 billion in market capitalization.[15]</p>
